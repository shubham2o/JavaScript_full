      <h2>1. How does JavaScript works?</h2>
      <p>
        1.1 JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that it is not
        compiled into machine code before it is executed. This makes JavaScript
        slower than compiled languages, but it also makes it more flexible and
        easier to debug.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.2 JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that the
        type of a variable is not declared explicitly. This can make JavaScript
        code more error-prone, but it also makes it more concise.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.3 JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means that only one
        piece of JavaScript code can be executed at a time. This can make
        JavaScript code less responsive, but it also makes it easier to write
        correct code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>STEP 1: PARSER</strong> <br />
        This is the first stage of the engine, every time we run a JavaScript
        program, our code is first received by the "parser" inside the JS
        engine. The parser's job is to check the JavaScript code for syntactic
        errors in line by line manner because JavaScript is an interpretive
        scripting language, so whenever an error is detected by the parser, it
        throws a kind of error and stops execution of the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>STEP 2: AST</strong> <br />
        Once the parser checks all javascript codes and gets satisfied that
        there are no mistakes/errors in the code, it creates the data structure
        called AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>STEP 3: CONVERSION TO MACHINE CODE</strong> <br />
        Once the Abstract Syntax Tree is created by the parser, the JavaScript
        engine converts the JavaScript code into the machine code (or in the
        language that machine can understand).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>STEP 4: MACHINE CODE</strong> <br />
        When the program written in the JavaScript gets converted in the machine
        language (or in the byte code), the converted code is sent to the system
        for execution, and finally, that byte code run by the system / engine.
