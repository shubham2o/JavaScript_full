      0. “This” keyword refers to the context and it depends on where it is
      operated. When “this” is used alone or in a function, it automatically
      refers to the global object, the owner of the function. But when the mode
      is “strict”, it is undefined.
    </p>

      1. The call() method calls a function with a given this value and
      arguments provided individually.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      2. The apply() method calls a function with a given this value, and
      arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object).
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      3. The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its
      this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments
      preceding any provided when the new function is called.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      4. When our code is repetitive, most of the time we can do better. Enter
      the powers of call, apply, and bind. Call, apply, and bind are JavaScript
      methods that allow a single function to be used on multiple objects.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      5. Polyfill for Call, Apply, and Bind method. Polyfill is a sort of
      browser fallback. What if suppose your browser have or support call, apply
      and bind function, then polyfills helps to write your own call, apply,
      bind function.

      --- Javascript is a synchronous and single-threaded language, but it can
      convert into asynchronous language.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- setTimeout and setInterval are provided by browser, they both are an
      API.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Callback refers to when a function takes another function an as
      argument and return it as an output.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Callback hell is callback inside callback inside callback inside
      callback and so on... To escape this, there are two ways in javascript ---
      1. Promises,,, and 2. async/await.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Promise is a value which we don't know now in present but will surely
      know in the future. Promise is a constructor function. In promise we pass
      a function which is known an executor function which takes two parameters
      i.e., resolve, reject.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- The microtask queue and callback queue are two queues used by the
      JavaScript event loop to execute asynchronous tasks.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Microtask queue is a high-priority queue that is processed before the
      callback queue. This means that microtask are executed as soon as
      possible, even if there are other tasks waiting in the callback queue.
      Microtask typically include tasks such as mutation observers and Promise
      resolution.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Callback queue is a lower-priority queue that is processed after the
      microtask queue is empty. This means that callback tasks are executed
      after all microtask have completed. Callback tasks typically include tasks
      such as setTimeout and setInterval.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- In simple words, the microtask queue is for tasks that need to be
      executed immediately, while the callback queue is for tasks that can wait
      a little longer.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>--- then method always returns a promise.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- HTTP request / AJAX request / API call / AJAX is the medium to
      interact in between client and server.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- AJAX is a set of web development techniques which we use on the client
      side to create asynchronous web applications. For example, we want to read
      some data or we want to get some data from the server, so in this case we
      can request HTTP and browser does this for us asynchronously in the
      background without letting us know.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server
      asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display
      and behavior of the existing page.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>--- We don't use data in XML format anymore. We use JSON now.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- We have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server --- 1.
      xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing),,, 2. fetch API (new way of doing),,,
      and 3. axios (this is third party library)
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- JSON.parse() is used to convert JSON String file into Javascript
      Object.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- fetch() will by default send request to the server on its own without
      manually typing all the code, like we use to do in XML. fetch() will
      return or give a Promise as an output. fetch() will only reject when we
      will get network related errors, i.e., onerror.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>--- You can remove the use of .then() using async and await.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- If you write async before a function in javascript, then it no will
      longer be a normal function. Now, it will every time return or give a
      Promise as an output when it is invoked or called.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Variables are used to store data, values in javascript. They can store
      various data of various datatype.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Variables and functions are hoisted which means that there declaration
      is moved on top of the code. We can access the value of a variable
      declared using var before it has been initialized and initialized.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- 7 Primitive Data Types are string, number, BigInt, null, undefined,
      boolean and symbol. Primitive data types are fixed, they cannot be
      changed. Values are passed by value.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- 3 Reference Data Types are [Arrays], {Objects}, and (Functions).
      Reference data types are variable, they can be changed easily. Values are
      passed by reference.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- We can store only a single value in a variable, but if we want to
      store multiple values in a variable of different data types then we can do
      so with the help of an Array. In short, arrays are group of values.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- let and const are block scoped {}, var is function scoped (). var adds
      itself to the window object. let and const are introduced in ES6 (2015)
      while var is from previous version i.e., ES5 (2009) or earlier.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Javascript does not have all the features, and some of the features
      which we uses are coming directly from the window browser object as
      javascript does not have all of them. Some of the features are alert(),
      prompt(), console(), setInterval(), setTimeout(), clearInterval(),
      clearTimeout(), document, fetch(), and etc.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Spread Operator helps to copy the values of the variables of Reference
      Data Types.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>--- Falsy values are 0, null, undefined, false, NaN, document.all</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- forEach loop in javascript only works on an array. This means that
      whenever you have an array, then forEach loop comes into use. By default,
      forEach() method never changes the value of the original array. It makes
      changes on the temporary copy the original array which makes the original
      array unchanged or same.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Function Expressions in JavaScript are first class functions. This
      means that functions can be treated as values in JavaScript. They can be
      passed as arguments to other functions, they can be returned from
      functions, and they can be stored in variables.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Higher Order Function are the function which accepts functions in a
      parameter or return a function or both.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- When you want to create many objects with the same properties and
      methods, then in this case you can use the Constructor function.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Whenever a new keyword is used in javascript, just create an imaginary
      object in your mind. This means that a new object will sooner be created
      because of usage of the new keyword.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Immediately Invoked Function Expression is a special type of function
      expression in JavaScript that is executed immediately after it is defined.
      The function() keyword defines the IIFE, and the () parentheses execute
      the IIFE immediately. The {} curly braces contain the code that should be
      executed once. This function helps us to create a private variables which
      are not accessible anywhere outside of their scope.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Prototype is basically the collection of built-in functions and
      methods that is available in JavaScript for us to use.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>--- Function inside an object is known as Method.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- When you want to run a function in which the value of this is
      something else but you want the value of this to be some other object,
      then in this case call(), apply(), and bind() method are used.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- In javascript, both synchronous and asynchronous code gets processed
      side by side at the same time, this is known as concurrency.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Parallelism focuses more on the different processors and on its cores.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      --- Polyfill is a kind of browser fallback, lets say your browser doesn't
      support call, apply, bind method, then you'll have to use polyfill to
      implement these methods.
