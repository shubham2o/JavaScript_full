      0. “This” keyword refers to the context and it depends on where it is
      operated. When “this” is used alone or in a function, it automatically
      refers to the global object, the owner of the function. But when the mode
      is “strict”, it is undefined.

      1. The call() method calls a function with a given this value and
      arguments provided individually.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The apply() method calls a function with a given this value, and
      arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object).
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its
      this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments
      preceding any provided when the new function is called.

      4. When our code is repetitive, most of the time we can do better. Enter
      the powers of call, apply, and bind. Call, apply, and bind are JavaScript
      methods that allow a single function to be used on multiple objects.

      5. Polyfill for Call, Apply, and Bind method. Polyfill is a sort of
      browser fallback. What if suppose your browser have or support call, apply
      and bind function, then polyfills helps to write your own call, apply,
      bind function.
