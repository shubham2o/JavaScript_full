        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>1.1 NetScape Navigator in 1995 realized that the website should be interactive enough.</p>
        <p>1.2 So, Brendan Eich in 10 days build JavaScript. But it was firstly named Mocha and not JavaScript. It was
            later changed to name LiveScript. But LiveScript name was also later changed to JavaScript because of
            popularity of the other programming language Java.</p>
        <p>1.3 During this time, Internet Explorer realized and got to know the popularity of NetScape Navigator and its
            language JavaScript. So, they also build a language by doing some modification to the javascript language
            and gave it a name, called JScript.</p>
        <p>1.4 During that time Netscape Navigator build JavaScript and Internet Explorer which was owned by Microsoft
            back then, build JScript.</p>
        <p>1.5 But, the problem was when we used javascript to build a website, then it was only looking attractive or
            working properly on its originated platform which was NetScape Navigator. Similarly, the same situation
            was with the Internet Explorer browser and its originated language JScript. People also had started to write
            that this website is best viewed with the NetScape Navigator browser or open this website using the Internet
            Explorer.</p>
        <p>1.6 One of the drawback was that people don't have big budgets to be able to develop a single website on both
            the platform as both the platform were not environment friendly. </p>
        <p>1.7 Now, ECMA (European Computer Manufacturing Association) came into the scene.</p>
        <p>1.8 ECMA decides what a technology or language should behave or work like. It also does the standardization
            part of the language or the technology. So, during that time ECMA decides that how a scripting language
            working on any web browser should perform or behave like. This means that if anyone wants to implement
            javascript into their programming language then they should follow mentioned rules and regulations (inside
            the documentation) into their programming language. Same rules should be followed and should behave in the
            same way as well.</p>
        <p>1.9 They named it as ECMAScript because javascript name trademark was with Oracle.</p>
        <p>1.10 ES1 means ECMAScript 1. <br>
            ES1 : 1997, <br>
            ES2, <br>
            ES3, <br>
            ES4, <br>
            ES5 : 2009, <br>
            In 2009, ES:5 had lots of new features and more people had started engaging with it. </p>
        <p>1.11 Now directly in 2015, comes ES:6 and it was the biggest update in the history of javascript.</p>
        <p>1.12 ECMA has a group known as TC39 (Technical Committee 39), which decides what features should be there in
            the new JavaScript, etc. This TC39 decided that they will release new version of JavaScript annually, every
            year.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>2. Backward Compatible, not Forward Compatible</h2>
        <p>2.1 JavaScript is a Backward Compatible language, this means if an old feature which was developed or
            introduced, let say 15 years ago, will also be easily work and perform in today's updated javascript
            language.</p>
        <p>2.2 But, javascript is not forward compatible, this means the new javascript feature, let say, which is
            developed or introduced today will not be able to work on the old un-updated web browser.</p>
        <p>2.3 The solution to this problem are some tools such as Babel, etc.</p>
        <p>2.4 Babel transpile or converts the modern javascript code (which is written in today's updated
            JavaScript language containing new features) to the un-updated browser's supporting old javascript language
            and old features.</p>

    <!-- 3. defer attribute -->
    <div>
        <h2>3. defer attribute</h2>
        <p>3.1 The defer attribute is used in HTML script tags to defer the execution of a Javascript file until the
            HTML page has finished parsing.</p>
        <p>3.2 This means that the script will only be executed after the HTML has been completed loaded, parsed, and
            displayed to the user. This is useful for optimizing page load times because it allows the HTML to be
            displayed to the user faster, and the javascript can execute in the background.</p>
        <p>3.3 If you want to add script tag in the head section of the html page, then you should add defer to the
            script tag as it will be deferred until after the HTML has been fully loaded and parsed.</p>

    <!-- 4. "use strict" -->
    <div>
        <h2>4. "use strict"</h2>
        <p>4.1 The "use strict" statement is a directive that enables stricter parsing and error handling in your
            javascript code. When used, it will enforce stricter rules for syntax, variable declaration, and other
            common mistakes.</p>
        <p>4.2 Note that "use strict" must be placed at the top of your JavaScript file or function in order to take
            effect. </p>

        <p>5.2 You cannot use spaces.</p>
        <p>5.3 You can use only underscore or dollar symbol.</p>
        <p>5.4 You cannot start with a number.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>6. String </h2>
        <p>6.1 In javascript, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes(' ') or double quotes(" ").
        </p>
        <p>6.2 Strings are used to represent textual data and can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace.</p>
        <p>6.3 Strings are immutable, which means that once a string is created, its value cannot be changed. However,
            you can create new strings based on existing ones using various string methods or concatenation.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>7. == v ===</h2>
        <p>7.1 == only checks the value of the variables are equal or not irrespective of their different data-type, if
            the value of the variables are equal than it will return true otherwise false.</p>
        <p>7.2 == only checks the value of the variable and not the data-type to the variable.</p>
        <p>7.3 === checks both value of the variables as well as the data-type of the variables. If both the value and
            datatype of a variable equals or matches the value and datatype of another variable, then it will return
            true, otherwise if any one value or datatype doesn't matches, it will return false.</p>

    <!-- 8. Ternary Operator -->
    <div>
        <h2>8. Ternary Operator</h2>
        <p>8.1 The ternary operator in javascript is a concise way to write conditional statements. It allows you to
            evaluate a condition and return one of two expression based on the result of the condition.</p>
        <p>8.2 The ternary operator is often used as a shorthand alternative to writing if-else statements. It's useful
            when you need to assign a value to a variable or return a value based on a condition.</p>
        <p>8.3 Using the ternary operator can make your code more concise and readable, especially for simple
            conditional assignments or returns.</p>
        <p>8.4 However, it's important to use it judiciously to maintain code clarity and avoid excessive nesting, which
            can make the code harder to understand.</p>

    <!-- 9. Switch Statement -->
    <div>
        <h2>9. Switch Statement</h2>
        <p>9.1 A switch statement in javascript is a control flow statement that allows you to perform different actions
            based on different conditions.</p>
        <p>9.2 It provides a more concise and organized way to write multiple 'if...else' statement.</p>
        <p>9.3 The switch statement is a useful tool when you have multiple conditions to check against a single
            expression. It provides a clearer and more efficient alternative to writing multiple 'if...else' statements.

    <!-- 10. While Loop -->
    <div>
        <h2>10. While Loop</h2>
        <p>10.1 In javascript, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of
            code as long as a specified condition is true.</p>
        <p>10.2 Remember to ensure that the condition within the while loop eventually becomes false; otherwise, the
            loop will continue indefinitely, resulting in an infinite loop.</p>
        <p>10.3 It's important to include a mechanism within the loop to modify the condition and eventually exit the
            loop.</p>

    <!-- 11. for Loop -->
    <div>
        <h2>11. for Loop</h2>
        <p>11.1 In JavaScript, a for loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code for a specific number of
            iterations. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration expression.</p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <!-- 12. Break keyword -->
    <div>
        <h2>12. Break keyword</h2>
        <p>12.1 In JavaScript, the break keyword is used within loops to exit the loop prematurely. It is typically used
            in conjunction with an if statement to test for a certain condition and then exit the loop if the condition
            is met. </p>
        <p>12.2 The break keyword can also be used with nested loops to exit the innermost loop.</p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <!-- 13. Continue keyword -->
    <div>
        <h2>13. Continue keyword</h2>
        <p>13.1 In Javascript, the continue keyword is used inside loop structures (such as 'for', 'while', or
            'do...while') to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. It is primarily
            used to control the flow within loops.</p>
        <p>13.2 When the continue statement is encountered, the remaining code inside the loop block for the current
            iteration is skipped, and the loop immediately proceeds to the next iteration.</p>
        <p>13.3 The continue statement is handy when you want to execute specific values or conditions from being
            processed within a loop and proceed to the next iteration.</p>

    <!-- 14. do while loop -->
    <div>
        <h2>14. do while loop</h2>
        <p>14.1 The do while loop is a variation of the while loop. The do-while loop executes a block of code
            repeatedly until a specified condition evaluates to false.</p>
        <p>14.2 The key difference between the do-while and the while-loop is that the do-while loop always executes the
            block of code at least once, regardless of whether the condition is initially true or false.</p>
        <p>14.3 It's important to ensure that the condition within the while statement eventually evaluates to false;
            otherwise, the loop will continue indefinitely, resulting in an infinite loop.</p>

    <!-- 15. Reference Data Types -->
    <div>
        <h2>15. Reference Data Types</h2>
        <p>15.1 They are dynamic in nature, i.e, they do not have a fixed size.</p>
        <p>15.2 Most of them are considered as objects, and therefore have methods.</p>
        <p>15.3 Such as - Arrays, functions, collections and all other object types. </p>

    </div>
    <!-- 16. Arrays -->
    <div>
        <h2>16. Arrays</h2>
        <p>16.1 An ordered collection of items or elements is commonly called as an array. </p>
        <p>16.2 An array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays can
            hold elements of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.</p>
        <p>16.3 Arrays in Javascript are dynamic, meaning their size can change dynamically by adding or removing
            elements. </p>
        <p>16.4 Arrays are mutable, which means that their elements can be modified after they have been created.</p>
        <p>16.5 In javascript, push() and pop() methods are generally faster than the unshift() and shift() methods. The
            reason for this is that push() and pop() only modify the last element of the array, whereas unshift() and
            shift() modify the first element of the array, which requires shifting all the remaining elements to new
            indexes. </p>

    <!-- 17. Primitive v Reference Data Types -->
    <div>
        <h2>17. Primitive v Reference Data Types</h2>
        <p>17.1 When you assign a primitive data type (such as number) to a variable, the value is copied to the
            variable.</p>
        <p>17.2 This means that changes made to the value of one variable will not affect the value of the another
            variable that was assigned the same value.</p>
        <p>17.3 Arrays are reference data types in javascript. When you assign an array to a variable, the variable
            actually stores a reference to the array in memory.</p>
        <p>17.4 When you assign a reference type to another variable, both variables refer to the same object in memory.
            Therefore, changes made to the object through one variable are reflected in the other variable as well.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>18. Objects or Object Literals</h2>
        <p>18.1 Arrays are good but are not sufficient enough for the real world data. So, for this we need objects.</p>
        <p>18.2 Objects store key, value pairs.</p>
        <p>18.3 Objects don't have index.</p>
        <p>18.4 It is a versatile and powerful feature that enables you to represent complex entities and their
            properties. Objects can contain various types of values, including other objects, arrays, functions and
            primitive data types. </p>
        <p>18.5 They are dynamic, which means you can add, remove, or modify properties and methods at runtime. They
            provide a flexible way to represent and manipulate data structures, making them an essential part of
            javascript programming. </p>
        <p>18.6 Object keys are always string or symbol, even if you use another data type as the key. So, you can also
            create an object like using double quotation.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>19. Dot v Bracket Notation</h2>
        <p>19.1 Dot Notation is more concise and easier to read for simple property access, while bracket notation is
            more versatile and allows for dynamic and complex property access.</p>
        <p>19.2 In general, dot notation is the preferred choice for accessing object properties when the property name
            is known in advance and is a valid identifier. Bracket notation is more flexible and allows for dynamic
            property access, making it suitable for scenarios where the property names are determined dynamically or
            contain special characters. </p>

    <!-- 20. Function Declaration -->
    <div>
        <h2>20. Function Declaration</h2>
        <p>20.1 In javascript, function declarations are used to create named functions that can be called later in
            the code. A function declaration consists of the 'function' keyword followed by the name of the
            function, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and the function body enclosed in curly braces.
        </p>
        <p>20.2 It's important to note that function declarations create functions as variables in the current
            scope. Therefore, they can be accessed and called from anywhere within the scope.</p>
        <p>20.3 Function declarations are particularly useful when you want to create reusable pieces of code that
            can be called multiple times throughout your program.</p>
        <p>20.4 Calling a function and invoking a function refer to the same thing - the act of executing a
            function in a program.</p>
        <p>20.5 The purpose of the return statement is to exit the function as soon as the target value is found.
            Without the 'return' statement, the function would continue iterating through the rest of the array even
            after the target value is changed. </p>

        <h2>21. Function Expression</h2>
        <p>21.1 In javascript, a function expression involves assigning a function to a variable or a constant. Function
            expressions can be named or anonymous.</p>
        <p>21.2 Function expressions provide a way to create functions on the fly, assign them to variables, and use
            them in various contexts within javascript. </p>

    <!-- 22. Arrow Functions -->
    <div>
        <h2>22. Arrow Functions</h2>
        <p>22.1 Arrow functions also known as fat arrow functions, are a concise syntax introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6)
            for creating functions in Javascript.</p>
        <p>22.2 They provide a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions and lexically bind this
            value, resulting in some differences in behavior. </p>
        <p>22.3 Arrow functions are used in scenarios where a concise and lexical 'this' binding is desired, such as in
            event handlers, array methods like map(), filter() and reduce() and when working with a asynchronous
            functions.</p>
        <p>22.4 It's important to note that arrow functions are not suitable for all use cases, particularly when
            dynamic scoping or the this value is needed. In such cases, traditional function expressions are still the
            appropriate choice.</p>
        <p>22.5 You can remove the parentheses, curly braces and return keyword when using an arrow function in
            javascript if you have only one parameter to pass. </p>

    <!-- 23. Function Declaration v Function Expression v Arrow Function -->
    <div>
        <h2>23. Function Declaration v Function Expression v Arrow Function</h2>
        <p>23.1 The choice between function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions depends on the
            specific context and requirements of your code. Each type of function has its own strengths and use cases.
        </p>
        <p>23.2 Scope and hoisting requirements: If you need the function to be accessible throughout the entire scope
            and be hoisted, function declarations are suitable choice. Otherwise, function expressions or arrow
            functions can be used. </p>
        <p>23.3 Readability and code style: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax, which can enhance code
            readability, especially for simple and short functions. However, for more complex functions, traditional
            function declarations or expression may be easier to understand. </p>
        <p>23.4 'this' binding: Arrow functions have a lexically bound this value, which can be advantageous in certain
            cases. If you rely on dynamic scoping or need to manipulate the this value, regular functions or function
            expressions may be more appropriate. </p>
        <p>23.5 In summary, there is no single best type of function. Each has its own strengths and use cases, so
            choose the one that best suits the specific requirements and coding style of your project. </p>

    <!-- 24. Hoisting -->
    <div>
        <h2>24. Hoisting</h2>
        <p>24.1 Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism that allows variables and function declaration to be moved to the top
            of their respective scopes during the compilation phase. </p>
        <p>24.2 Hoisting is a concept specific to variable and function declarations, not their initialization or
            assignments. The actual assignment or initialization still happens at the original position in the code.</p>
        <p>24.3 Variable Hoisting (var, let and const): When variable are hoisted, the variable declaration are moved to
            the top of their scope while keeping their assignments in place. However, only the declarations are hoisted,
            not the initializations. If you access a variable before its declaration, it will have the value
            'undefined'.</p>
        <p>24.4 Function Hoisting: Function declarations are fully hoisted, which means that both the function name and
            its body are moved to the top of the scope. As a result, you can call a function before its actual
            declaration in the code.</p>
        <p>24.5 Hoisting with Function Expression: Function expressions, which are assigned to variables, are not
            hoisted in the same way as function declarations. Only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function
            assignment. </p>
        <p>24.6 It's important to understand hoisting to avoid unexpected behavior and write clear and maintainable
            code. To ensure code clarity, it is generally recommended to declare variables at the top of their scope and
            declare functions before they are used, regardless of hoisting behavior. </p>

        <p>25.1 When a function is defined inside another function, it is referred to as a "nested function" or "inner
            function". The outer function is commonly known as the "parent function" or "containing function".</p>
        <p>25.2 It's important to note that inner functions are only accessible within the scope of the outer function.
            They cannot be directly called from outside the outer function. However, if the outer function returns the
            inner function or exposes it through an object, you can invoke the inner function from the outside. </p>

            specifically the location where the variables and functions are defined in the source code. Lexical scope
            determines how variable names are resolved during the execution of the code. </p>
        <p>26.2 When a variable or function is defined inside another function, the inner function has access to the
            variables and functions of its outer function. This access is possible because javascript uses lexical
            scoping. Lexical scoping means that the scope of a variable or function is determined by its position in the
            source code during the lexical analysis phase, regardless of where it is called during the runtime. </p>
        <p>26.3 It is important for understanding how variables are resolved and accessed in javascript. It helps create
            encapsulation and enables the use of of closures, where functions retain access to variables even after
            their outer function has finished executing.</p>

        <h2>27. Block Scope v Function Scope</h2>
        <p>27.1 let and const are block scope.</p>
        <p>27.2 var is a function scope.</p>
        <p>27.3 Block Scope refers to the visibility and lifetime of variables and functions within a block of code,
            which is typically defined by a pair of curly braces. Block scope was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) with
            the let and const keywords. Variables defined with the let and const are block-scoped and are accessible
            only within the block they are defined in. </p>
        <p>27.4 Function Scope refers to the visibility and lifetime of variables and functions within the enclosing
            function. Variables declared with the var keyword have function scope and are accessible throughout the
            entire function, regardless of where they are defined within the function. </p>
        <p>27.5 Block scope allows for better encapsulation and reduces the likelihood of variable collisions and
            unintended access. </p>

    <div>
        <h2>28. Default parameters</h2>
        <p>28.1 Default parameters allow you to assign default values to function parameters if no argument or an
            undefined value is passed when calling the function. Default parameters were introduced in ECMAScript 2015
            (ES6) and are a convenient way to handle missing or undefined values. </p>
        <p>28.2 It is worth noting that default parameters are evaluated at the time the function is called, no when
            it's defined.</p>
        <p>28.3 This allows you to use variables or expressions as default values. However, if a default parameter
            depends on the value of another parameter, you need to be cautious about the order in which the parameters
            are defined.</p>
        <p>28.4 Additionally, default parameters work with any function, not just named function. They can be used with
            arrow functions, methods, and even function expressions. </p>

    <div>
        <h2>29. Rest parameters</h2>
        <p>29.1 Rest parameters allow you to present an indefinite number of arguments as an array with a function. Rest
            parameter were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and provide a concise way to work with variable-length
            argument lists. </p>
        <p>29.2 They are useful when you want to work with functions that can accept a variable number of arguments.
            Instead of accessing the argument through the 'arguments' object, you can use the rest parameter to gather
            them conveniently into an array. </p>
        <p>29.3 They must be the last parameter in the function's parameter list, as it collects all remaining
            arguments. If desired, you can have regular parameters before the rest parameter. </p>
        <p>29.4 The spread syntax can be used to pass an array to a function as separate argument. This is the inverse
            of rest parameter, where the spread syntax spread an array into individual arguments. </p>

        <h2>30. Parameter Destructuring</h2>
        <p>30.1 Parameter Destructuring allows you to extract individual values from an object or an array and assign
            them to variables within the function parameter list. It provides a concise way to access specific
            properties or elements of complex data structures. </p>
        <p>30.2 It is a powerful technique that allows you to access specific values from objects or arrays more
            conveniently within function parameters. It can help simplify code and make it more readable, especially
            when working with complex data structures. </p>

        <h2>31. Callback / Higher Order Functions</h2>
        <p>31.1 Higher-order functions can take other functions as arguments and/or return functions as their results.
            Essentially, they treat functions as values, enabling powerful functional programming patterns and
            abstraction. </p>
        <p>31.2 A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked or
            called within that function. Callback functions are a fundamental concept in Javascript, especially in
            asynchronous programming and event handling. </p>
        <p>31.3 They are often used in scenarios where an operation takes time to complete, such as making an
            asynchronous request or waiting for an event to occur. The callback function allows you to specify what
            action should be taken once the operation is finished or the event is triggered. </p>
        <p>31.4 Asynchronous functions in javascript commonly use callbacks to handle the result or error of an
            operation.</p>
        <p>31.5 They allow for more flexible and dynamic programming patterns, such as executing different actions
            depending on the outcome of a function or operation.</p>

        <h2>32. Function returning Functions / Higher Order Functions</h2>
        <p>32.1 In Javascript, functions can return other functions, which is a powerful concept known as "function
            returning functions" or "higher-order functions". This allows for the creation of dynamic and specialized
            functions based on the input or configuration provided. </p>
        <p>32.2 It is useful when you need to create variations or customizations of a core functionality. They provide
            a way to encapsulate behavior and create specialized function without duplicating code. </p>
        <p>32.3 It facilitates code reuse, and contribute to a more expressive and functional programming style in
            JavaScript. </p>

        <h2>33. Important Array Methods</h2>
        <!-- 33.1 forEach() Method -->
        <strong>33.1 forEach() Method</strong>
        <p>33.1.1 forEach() method is a built-in method available on arrays. It allows you to iterate over the elements
            of an array and perform a specified action for each element. </p>
        <p>33.1.2 It takes a callback function as an argument, which will be executed for each element in the array. The
            callback function can take up to three parameters: "currentValue", "index" (optional) and "array"(optional).
        </p>
        <p>33.1.3 It is important to note that the forEach() method does not return a value. It simply performs an
            action for each element of the array. If you need to perform operations that accumulate a result or return a
            new value, other array methods like "reduce()" might be more suitable.</p>
        <p>33.1.4 Although forEach() method is a method available on arrays and it takes a callback function as an
            argument, it does not meet the criteria of a higher-order function. </p>
        <p>33.1.5 In javascript, an anonymous function is a function that does not have a name identifier. Instead of
            assigning a name to a function, we can assign it directly to a variable, or pass it as an argument to
            another function. </p>
