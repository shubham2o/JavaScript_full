        <!-- 1. Introduction -->
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>1.1 NetScape Navigator in 1995 realized that the website should be interactive enough.</p>
        <p>1.2 So, Brendan Eich in 10 days build JavaScript. But it was firstly named Mocha and not JavaScript. It was
            later changed to name LiveScript. But LiveScript name was also later changed to JavaScript because of
            popularity of the other programming language Java.</p>
        <p>1.3 During this time, Internet Explorer realized and got to know the popularity of NetScape Navigator and its
            language JavaScript. So, they also build a language by doing some modification to the javascript language
            and gave it a name, called JScript.</p>
        <p>1.4 During that time Netscape Navigator build JavaScript and Internet Explorer which was owned by Microsoft
            back then, build JScript.</p>
        <p>1.5 But, the problem was when we used javascript to build a website, then it was only looking attractive or
            working properly on its originated platform which was NetScape Navigator. Similarly, the same situation
            was with the Internet Explorer browser and its originated language JScript. People also had started to write
            that this website is best viewed with the NetScape Navigator browser or open this website using the Internet
            Explorer.</p>
        <p>1.6 One of the drawback was that people don't have big budgets to be able to develop a single website on both
            the platform as both the platform were not environment friendly. </p>
        <p>1.7 Now, ECMA (European Computer Manufacturing Association) came into the scene.</p>
        <p>1.8 ECMA decides what a technology or language should behave or work like. It also does the standardization
            part of the language or the technology. So, during that time ECMA decides that how a scripting language
            working on any web browser should perform or behave like. This means that if anyone wants to implement
            javascript into their programming language then they should follow mentioned rules and regulations (inside
            the documentation) into their programming language. Same rules should be followed and should behave in the
            same way as well.</p>
        <p>1.9 They named it as ECMAScript because javascript name trademark was with Oracle.</p>
        <p>1.10 ES1 means ECMAScript 1. <br>
            ES1 : 1997, <br>
            ES2, <br>
            ES3, <br>
            ES4, <br>
            ES5 : 2009, <br>
            In 2009, ES:5 had lots of new features and more people had started engaging with it. </p>
        <p>1.11 Now directly in 2015, comes ES:6 and it was the biggest update in the history of javascript.</p>
        <p>1.12 ECMA has a group known as TC39 (Technical Committee 39), which decides what features should be there in
            the new JavaScript, etc. This TC39 decided that they will release new version of JavaScript annually, every
            year.</p>

        <!-- 2. Backward Compatible, not Forward Compatible -->
        <h2>2. Backward Compatible, not Forward Compatible</h2>
        <p>2.1 JavaScript is a Backward Compatible language, this means if an old feature which was developed or
            introduced, let say 15 years ago, will also be easily work and perform in today's updated javascript
            language.</p>
        <p>2.2 But, javascript is not forward compatible, this means the new javascript feature, let say, which is
            developed or introduced today will not be able to work on the old un-updated web browser.</p>
        <p>2.3 The solution to this problem are some tools such as Babel, etc.</p>
        <p>2.4 Babel transpile or converts the modern javascript code (which is written in today's updated
            JavaScript language containing new features) to the un-updated browser's supporting old javascript language
            and old features.</p>

        <!-- 3. defer attribute -->
        <h2>3. defer attribute</h2>
        <p>3.1 The defer attribute is used in HTML script tags to defer the execution of a Javascript file until the
            HTML page has finished parsing.</p>
        <p>3.2 This means that the script will only be executed after the HTML has been completed loaded, parsed, and
            displayed to the user. This is useful for optimizing page load times because it allows the HTML to be
            displayed to the user faster, and the javascript can execute in the background.</p>
        <p>3.3 If you want to add script tag in the head section of the html page, then you should add defer to the
            script tag as it will be deferred until after the HTML has been fully loaded and parsed.</p>

        <!-- 4. "use strict" -->
        <h2>4. "use strict"</h2>
        <p>4.1 The "use strict" statement is a directive that enables stricter parsing and error handling in your
            javascript code. When used, it will enforce stricter rules for syntax, variable declaration, and other
            common mistakes.</p>
        <p>4.2 Note that "use strict" must be placed at the top of your JavaScript file or function in order to take
            effect. </p>

        <!-- 5. Conventions and Rules -->
        <h2>5. Conventions and Rules</h2>
        <p>5.1 Always start with the small letter and use camelCase or snake_case.</p>
        <p>5.2 You cannot use spaces.</p>
        <p>5.3 You can use only underscore or dollar symbol.</p>
        <p>5.4 You cannot start with a number.</p>

        <!-- 6. String -->
        <h2>6. String </h2>
        <p>6.1 In javascript, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes(' ') or double quotes(" ").
        </p>
        <p>6.2 Strings are used to represent textual data and can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace.</p>
        <p>6.3 Strings are immutable, which means that once a string is created, its value cannot be changed. However,
            you can create new strings based on existing ones using various string methods or concatenation.</p>
